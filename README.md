# Custom Linked List Library

This is a personal project where I am creating my own implementation of the **'std::list'** library, which is a doubly linked list container provided by the C++ Standard Library. My implementation is of a linked list container for integers currently.

## <span style="font-size: smaller;">Motivation</span>

 I started this project to improve my understanding of linked lists and gain experience working with pointers and dynamic memory allocation in C++.


## <span style="font-size: smaller;">Features</span>

My custom list library currently supports the following features:

- Creation of empty lists.
- Insertion and deletion of elements at the front and back of the list.
- Insertion and deletion of elements at a specific position in the list.
- Checking the size of the list.
- Iteration over the elements in the list.

## <span style="font-size: smaller;">Usage</span>

To use my custom list library, simply include the header file **'LinkedList.hpp'** and **'LinkedList.cpp'** in your project. You can then create a list object using the **'LinkedList'** class.
